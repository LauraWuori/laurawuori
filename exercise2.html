 <h1>WELCOME</h1>

 <p>Use classes when there are multiple elements on a single 
     web page that need to be styled. For example, 
     let's say that you want links in the page header and 
     footer to be styled in a consistent manner,
      but not the same way as the links in the body of the page. 
      To pinpoint those links you could add a class to each of 
      those links or the container holding the links. 
      Then, you could specify the styles using the class and be sure 
      that they would only be applied to the
       links with that class attribute.
