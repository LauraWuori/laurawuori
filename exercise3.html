<h2>Hello again.</h2>

<p>The British governor Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore
    on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice 
    for the new port.[49] The island was then nominally ruled by Tengku 
    Abdul Rahman, the Sultan of Johor, who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis.
    However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division: the Temenggong (Chief Minister) 
    of Tengku Abdul Rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to the Sultan's elder 
    brother Tengku Long, who was living in exile in Riau. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles 
    managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. Raffles offered to recognise Tengku Long 
    as the rightful Sultan of Johor, under the title of Sultan Hussein, as well as provide 
    him with a yearly payment of $5000 and another $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan
     Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.</p>

     <p>
       After the First World War, the British built the large Singapore
        Naval Base as part of the defensive Singapore strategy.
         Originally announced in 1921, the construction of the base was gradual until the
          Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Although not fully completed in 1938, 
          and at the large cost of $60 million, it was nonetheless the largest dry dock in 
          the world, the third-largest floating dock, and had enough fuel tanks to support the 
          entire British navy for six months.
